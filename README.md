# Next.js Hello World

This repo is forked from [nextjs/examples/hello-world](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/hello-world).

This example shows the most basic idea behind Next. We have 2 pages: `pages/index.js` and `pages/about.js`. The former responds to `/` requests and the latter to `/about`. Using `next/link` you can add hyperlinks between them with universal routing capabilities. The `day` directory shows that you can have subdirectories.

The app in this repo is deployed at https://next-js.onrender.com.
